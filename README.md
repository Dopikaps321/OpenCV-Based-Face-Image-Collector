# OpenCV-Based-Face-Image-Collector
A Python-based face image collector that uses OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time from a webcam and save the cropped face images locally. This tool can be used to create datasets for face recognition systems, machine learning projects, or computer vision research.
